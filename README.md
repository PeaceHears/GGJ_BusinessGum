A stressed-out businessman on the verge of missing the biggest meeting of his life. The problem? The skyscraper’s elevator is broken, and the rooftop boardroom is 50 floors up.
But he isn’t giving up just yet. Armed with his secret weapon, a pack of extra-elastic bubblegum, he hatches a plan: chew, blow, and fly. Soaring between skyscrapers with nothing but a massive bubble to hold him aloft, he must dodge rogue aggressive pigeons and seagulls, and even the occasional paper planes to make it to the meeting on time.
Can his bubble-blowing skills save his career? Or will he pop under pressure?
